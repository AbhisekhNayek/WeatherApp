# ‚òÄÔ∏è Simple Weather Website

The Simple Weather Website is a basic web application that provides current weather information for a specified location. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and relies on a weather API to fetch and display weather data.

## Features

- **Current Weather:** Get real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.

- **Location Search:** Enter a city or region to view the weather for that location.

## Usage

To use the Simple Weather Website, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

2. Enter a location (city or region) in the search bar and press the "Search" button.

3. The website will display the current weather conditions for the specified location.

## API

This website uses a weather API to fetch weather data. You can replace the API key and endpoint in the JavaScript code to use your preferred weather data source. For this example, we've used the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/).

```javascript
// Replace with your own API key and endpoint
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const apiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?`;
```
